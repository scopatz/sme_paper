\opening{Dear Editor,}

First, allow me to express my sincerest thanks for considering this 
article for publication.  I appreciate the herculean efforts that 
are involved with managing a technical journal.

I am personally very excited by the achievements contained in this article.  
I decided to submit it to \longinstname\, because a number of the papers
that this work is based off of were originally published here.  These surround
the explanation and implementation of matched abundance ratio cascade theory.  
However the methods used in this article seem to be a significant departure 
from what you typically publish, taking a much more applied computer science 
strategy.  Given the results that I have demonstrated, I believe that these 
unorthodox methods are well worth the effort.  I hope that you and the reviewers 
agree!

Additionally, the PDF of this document was prepared with LaTeX because this is 
output form of much of the software that I work with.  I had communicated
with Bonnie Cramer prior to submitting to ensure that this was acceptable.

Thank you again for your consideration.
